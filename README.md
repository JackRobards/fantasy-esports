# Fantasy eSports

[Site link](https://csgo-fantasy-esports.herokuapp.com/)

A Site Designed to emulate Fantasy Sports, similar to Fantasy Football or Basketball, but for the videogame CS:GO. CS:GO has a competitive scene with over 30 major tournaments scattered throughout the year, and fantasy CS:GO allows you to add extra entertainment to your competitive CS:GO viewing experience.

You choose your five favorite players participating in any given tournament and add them to your team. You compete with a thousand other people by trying to choose the "highest scoring" group of players at that tournament. Scoring is based off of how well that player performed at the tournament - how many kills, deaths, assists, etc. they had. If you place in the top spots, then you would be rewarded prizes.

### Defunct Site
This site is **NOT** maintained. It has been filled with some placeholder data to resemble what the site looked like when it functioned properly, but you will experience some things that do not function as intended.
